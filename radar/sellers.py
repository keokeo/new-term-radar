"""Signal ⑧: sites that just started taking money.

A product's first payment link says more than a launch post: someone built a thing and asked
for money for it. Payment links are ordinary links on the seller's own page, so the public link
graph (DataForSEO through AIsa) shows them, each with the day it was first seen:

- Stripe Payment Links (buy.stripe.com) and Polar checkout links (buy.polar.sh): every link is one;
- Lemon Squeezy store checkouts (<store>.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout or /buy);
- Gumroad product pages (.../l/<product>); profile pages are left out, spam networks use them;
- Creem payment pages (creem.io/payment/...);
- Paddle Classic checkouts (buy.paddle.com), Dodo Payments product links (checkout.dodopayments.com/buy/...) and
  Waffo Pancake's permanent product links (checkout.waffo.ai/{store}/{product}).

A new link is not a new seller: a site that has sold for years puts the same link on every new
page, and each page is a link first seen today. Of the 2,000 newest Stripe links on 2026-10-14,
two thirds came from sites that linked to Stripe before. So the day that counts is the day the
SITE first linked to the platform (its referring domain's first_seen), and only sites whose first
link is among the newest are kept.

Once a week (sellers.weekday, Monday by default) this reads the newest `per_platform` links and
the newest `per_platform` sites of each platform ($0.056 a platform on 2026-10-14), keeps the links
of new sites, drops the ones reported before and sites where anyone can post (GitHub, Reddit,
X ...), and keeps up to `max_leads` new sellers, busiest first when a GoAnyAPI key gives their
visits ($0.004 a site). A seller's link sits on its own home,
pricing or product page; the first real run showed what else carries payment links: user pages on
big platforms (framer.com templates, pub.dev packages, Flathub apps, forum threads, newsletters,
news articles). So the linking page must be a short, non-content path, the site must rank
`rank_max` or lower (DataForSEO's 0 to 1000 scale), and above `max_visits` a month it is a
platform, not a new seller. The home pages of the newest `pool` candidates are read, a small model
sorts them by kind (keyword rules when it cannot), and AI and software come first, then templates,
courses and the rest; within a kind, the busiest first. Each seller's home-page title and
description (read free) go to the keyword table as evidence, as for ⑥: the table reads the job
people pay for.

What it cannot see: checkouts created by code at the moment of payment (most of Stripe's
volume), and revenue. A link means the site sells, not that it sells well.
