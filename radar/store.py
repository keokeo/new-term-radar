"""The radar's memory: every lead it reported, in one SQLite file (state/radar.db).

record()          upserts today's leads.
due()             leads old enough to check in DataForSEO Trends and not checked yet.
save_verdict()    hit / miss / no_data and how many days the radar was ahead.
recent_sources()  X and Hugging Face leads the frequent job kept since yesterday.
summary()         hit rate and median lead per signal.

Lists are stored as JSON text; the file is small (one row per term) and safe to keep in
a CI cache or to commit.
