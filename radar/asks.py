"""Signal ⑦: what people ask for on Reddit ("is there an AI tool that…").

A request is demand said out loud. Once a week (asks.weekday, Monday by default) this searches
Reddit for the ways people ask for a tool (`patterns`, $0.0019 a query through AIsa), keeps the
posts of the last week, and a small model sorts each: a request for something that does a job,
a complaint about a tool, a solution someone shares, or other. For requests and complaints it
writes the job as the words a person would search ("convert powerpoint slides to notes"). The
jobs are sized with Google Ads volumes and the ones with searches are checked for room on page
one; each of those becomes a lead. Most asks are too specific to have searches yet ("add b roll
automatically"); the best scored of those are listed too, as ideas rather than keywords.
With `ai_answers` on, the jobs with searches are also put to ChatGPT (and Google's AI Mode)
as a question, to see which tools the answers name and which sites they cite
(radar/ai_answers.py).

Posts are read for research: quote them, do not republish them.
