"""Can a new site get onto page one? The other half of "do it or not".

Rising is not enough: a term whose first page is held by strong sites is a fight a new site
loses. For the table's rows that would be acted on (prioritize, then watch), up to `max_rows`
a run, this reads:

- Google's first page (DataForSEO through AIsa, about $0.002 a keyword): what kinds of pages
  hold it, and whether ads show (someone pays for that click: there is money in the term);
- the rating of each site there (GoAnyAPI, $0.002 a site, kept 30 days): `weak` counts the
  results on sites rated under 30, the slots a new site can take, and the weakest one is named;
- from the same page, what else holds it besides the ten results (`features`: an AI overview,
  an answer box, a forums block, videos, news) and the forum threads there (`forums`): an AI
  overview takes clicks, and a thread on page one is where an answer reaches the searchers;
- keyword difficulty (DataForSEO Labs, about $0.012 a call; often missing for a new term);
- with a GoAnyAPI key, who already builds for the term and who pays for it: how many pages
  Google holds with the term in their title from the last month (`built`, 4 credits) and the
  domains running Google ads on it (`paid`, Ads transparency, 4 credits).

`open`: three or more weak results, or difficulty under 20. `crowded`: no weak result and a
difficulty of 40 or more, or unknown. `mixed` in between. A term that first drew searches in
the last half year (radar/wordage.py, `is_new`) is read one step easier (crowded -> mixed,
mixed -> open): difficulty scores and ratings lag a new term. A crowded `prioritize` becomes
`watch`: still rising, but page one belongs to strong sites. Without a GoAnyAPI key there are
no ratings and only the difficulty speaks. In a name's first week page one is still forming
(news, the maker's own pages): read it again at the second reading.
