"""The radar as an MCP server, for clients such as Claude Code, Cursor or Claude Desktop.

  pip install mcp            # the only extra dependency, needed for this file alone
  python -m radar.mcp_server

Three tools:
  recent_leads   what the radar has kept, with review verdicts and hit rates. Free, instant.
  keyword_table  the generic terms behind names you give it, sized, with a decision each.
                 Paid (about $0.05 a name plus $0.09 a call) and slow: 40 to 90 seconds a name.
  run_radar      one `sources` or `daily` run, returning its report. Paid, and takes minutes:
                 meant for a first try, the schedule belongs in cron or GitHub Actions.

Where it looks: RADAR_CONFIG (default ./config.json, or the example the radar ships with when
there is none) and RADAR_STATE (default ./state), the same files the command line uses, so the
server sees what the scheduled runs kept. Keys come from the environment: AISA_API_KEY, and
optionally GOANYAPI_API_KEY.

The transport is stdio, so nothing here may print to stdout: the tools run the radar with
its output captured. A tool that fails reaches the agent as a ToolError with its reason (no key,
a refused call, a state folder it cannot write): mcp 2.x shows any other exception only as
"Error executing tool".
