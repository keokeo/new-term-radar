"""Markets: where a term is searched, and where it is easiest to rank for.

For the rows that would be acted on (prioritize and watch), in each market of `codes`
(US, DE, FR, JP by default): Google Ads monthly searches (the radar's volume source, one
call per market for all the rows; in the table's own market only what it has not looked up) and, with
`difficulty` on, the keyword difficulty there (DataForSEO Labs, one call per market;
often missing for an English term outside English markets). `best` is the market with the
most searches per point of difficulty when every market with searches has a difficulty,
else the one with the most searches: a ratio and a raw count are not compared.

With `top_region` on, one more Trends task per row (DataForSEO Trends' interest by region,
worldwide, 12 months) names the country where the term is most popular, on Trends' own
0-100 scale: a share of local searches, not a count. That share puts small places first
(Sint Maarten and Finland topped "photocraft" and "ai image detector" on 2026-10-18), so the
top region is chosen among the markets of LOCATIONS, `locations` and `codes` only.

The volumes are asked without a language, so they hold searches in every language a
market's users set; the difficulty needs one and takes the market's main language.

Costs seen in October 2026: $0.09 a volume call, about $0.012 a difficulty call, $0.0024
a region task. With the defaults that is four volume calls (the US one only when a name is
among the rows, which is nearly always) and four difficulty calls, $0.41 for two rows on
2026-10-18, plus $0.0024 a row.
