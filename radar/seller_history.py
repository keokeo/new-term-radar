"""Every seller a payment platform has, back to 2019: the history behind signal ⑧.

    python -m radar history pull   [--platform stripe] [--max-usd 20]
    python -m radar history update [--platform stripe] [--max-usd 3]
    python -m radar history read   [--workers 32]
    python -m radar history sort   [--max-usd 30] [--rules]
    python -m radar history        [--out sellers.csv]

`pull` reads every site that links to each platform today, one row per site with the day it
FIRST linked: DataForSEO's one-per-domain backlinks, oldest first, 1,000 a call ($0.06 on
2026-10-14). That day matched the site's referring-domain first_seen for every Polar site checked
(1,704). Stripe had about 143,000 such sites, Gumroad 140,000, Lemon Squeezy 18,000, Polar and
Creem about 2,000 each: about $18 for all five. Sites that took their link down are not in it, and
before mid-2021 the link graph saw few Stripe links. A pull stops at --max-usd and picks up where
it stopped on the next run.

`update` adds the sellers that appeared since the history's newest day: each platform's newest
links first, until a page reaches back past that day (an old seller's new page is skipped, about
two thirds of the rows; about $0.5 a week for all platforms). Run it weekly and the history grows
into a series: who started selling each week, and who added a second platform.

`read` fetches each seller's home page title and description (free, `--workers` at a time;
about 10 sites a second), `sort` has a small model sort the ones that answered by kind (an
estimated $0.005 for 60 sites; `--rules` sorts by keywords alone, free, and a later sort with the model
redoes those), and `history` alone counts sellers per month, platform and kind
and, with --out, writes every seller to a CSV. Only links that take money count as sellers (a
Gumroad product page, not a profile; see sellers.PLATFORMS); the rest are kept with pays = 0.

The rows are DataForSEO's: use them for research, do not republish them.
